This is a sample HTML error template for use with FormMail
(from www.tectite.com).

This sample uses a new tag format that works
with FormMail version 8.25 and FMBadHandler 1.22 and later.
The old tag format is available in another sample download.

Use this to understand how error templates work and
as a basis for your own template.

The idea is that you can create a page that looks like
a normal page on your website, but FormMail will insert
the error text in the place(s) you specify.

The basic error message is shown with this tag:
    [fmerror /]

The internal error code is shown with this tag:
    [fmerrorcode /]
(you generally wouldn't show that to the user).

The extra information is shown with this tag:
    [fmerrorextra /]

To full error (fmerror + fmerrorextra) is shown with
this tag:
    [fmfullerror /]

Individual error items can be shown with these tags:
    [fmerroritem1 /]
    [fmerroritem2 /]
    .
    .
    .
    [fmerroritem9 /]
    [fmerroritem10 /]
    .
    .
    .
    [fmerroritemN /]

The complete list of error items each enclosed
in <li></li> tags:
    [fmerroritemlist /]

    <!--
    If you use fmbadhandler.php from www.tectite.com,
    the following tag will insert the correct return link to the form.
    You need to configure FMBadHandler correctly for this to work.
    In particular, you need to set $TARGET_URLS appropriately.

    Note that, in general, you only want a return link
    for user-level errors.  There's no point in the user
    returning to the form for system-level errors.
    -->
    [return_link /]
[/fmusererror]

<!--
The following is only included for system-level errors.
An example is when you haven't setup your email recipients properly.
In general, the user cannot repair system-level errors by retrying the form.
-->
[fmsyserror]
    <p>There is a problem with the server.  Please contact us
    using email or telephone.</p>
