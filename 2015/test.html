                <li>3. Have I achieved my own goals?</li>

    <a name="dos" class="h1">RESUME DOs</a>
    <p></p>
    <ul id="dosdonts">
        <li>1. Create a resume that is easy to read &#8212; use a traditional format &#8212; job history in reverse chronological order. In recent years, the mixed functional / chronological format has achieved acceptance. Functional only resumes should be avoided, dates are important.</li>
        <li>2. Keep it short &#8211; one to two page resumes are the current standard. Concentrate on the most recent 5 &#8211; 7 years (if applicable!). Any previous experience is obsolete &#8212; you are either using the skills in your current position or technology has marched on without you. </li>
        <li>3. Your resume muse be clear, concise and persuasive. List your major responsibilities and what you have accomplished given those responsibilities. Quantify them &#8211; claims supported by numbers, dollar amounts and percentages are more convincing. Remember: Past performance is an indication of future behavior. Your next employer is looking for someone who has saved money or improved production. </li>
        <li>4. Professional appearance is critical. Have your resume printed on a good quality white, off white or buff paper. </li>
        <li>5. Remember &#8211; a resume is a visual &#8212; a piece of art. Don&#8217;t fill it up with words. Allow just enough white space to move the eye left to right, up and down. Use bullets to highlight major responsibilities and accomplishments. </li>
        <li>6. Be sure your resume is easy to scan into a computer. Avoid using italic, long underlining, borders and shading. </li>
        <li>7. Use verbs &#8212; action words are critical. Substitute verbs for adjectives and adverbs. (see action word list) </li>
        <li>8. Begin your resume with a summary of qualifications. Introduce yourself to the reader in three of four sentences or short bulleted fragments that highlight your skills. Objectives are usually too bland or too specific for each opportunity. </li>
        <li>9. When stating your education be specific about the degree, what school, what city, and the date of the degree. If your GPA is excellent &#8211; list it. Employers need this information to verify your degree. Recent graduates should include list of relevant courses &#8211;an unofficial college transcript is good. Define your time management skills &#8212; if you worked 20 hours, participated in activities such as the marching band and still maintained a 3.0 GPA &#8211; you have great potential in the &#8220;REAL&#8221; world ! </li>
        <li>10. Include a brief cover letter &#8212; [for recruiters] the cover letter should include your most recent salary and a phone number where you are most likely to be reached. The cover letter should spell out geographical desires and interests. </li>
    </ul>

    <a name="reach" class="h1">REACH OUT AND TOUCH SOMEONE</a>
    <p style="line-height:1.3em">Building credibility is more than just avoiding revealing gaffes. It requires doing enough background research to identify your target audience and its vital interests. If the reader for the company he represents is truly your best prospect try crawling into his head and asking the same questions of your resume that he will ask &#8211; in roughly the same order. If you can&#8217;t do that, then you know your market yet and should do more research. Imagine finding a piece of information before your eyes, at the precise moment your mental organizing apparatus signals a need for it. What if this happens several times over two pages. Such compatibility is exactly what your reader wants. </p>
