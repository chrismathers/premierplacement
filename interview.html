<br><a name="sell" class=heading>SUCCESSFULLY SELLING YOUR SKILLS AT THE INTERVIEW</a><p>

Approach each interview as a challenge,  with the measure of success being the receipt of a position offer. Once you have an offer in hand, you can carefully decide whether the opportunity is right for you. Without the offer, you have one less available option.

There is absolutely no substitute for thorough and well-planned interview preparation. It can be the most important factor achieving your goal. The following are some thoughts to bear in mind when going through this process:
<p>
<b>FIRST</b>, Know as much about the Company and the interviewer as possible, before your interview.
<p>
<b>SECOND</b>, Know yourself and what you're selling! Here are some basic principles of "personal" marketing.
<ul class=default>
<li>Know the results  of your accomplishments.   Sell these, and not your functional experience.</li>

<li>Be selective in selling your accomplishments, making sure to demonstrate a growth pattern.</li>

<li>Be factual when talking about your accomplishments, making  liberal use of actual situations by means of illustrations.</li>

<li>Let the interviewer value you through your illustrations of your efforts and their results.</li>

<li>Maintain your best self-image,  and live up to it during the interview as well as on the job. Remember,  most people accept others at face value! Do not undersell yourself by letting false modesty  get in your way -- this is the time for gathering acceptance by presenting your highest worth.   Watch your personal image!  Know your accomplishments -- they are your "sales tools."  Relate your illustrative accounts of your accomplishments to his needs and requirements!</li>
</ul><P>
<b>THIRD</b>, Listen to the interviewer and try to understand what he feels with respect to the job opening.
<p>
<b>FOURTH</b>, Be brief in your replies, answering the questions.  Do not volunteer other information than that which is asked for. Prepare yourself to handle, in a positive way. any questions an interviewer might ask of you.
Note:	Good preparation for the interview -- have a friend role play an interview situation where he 
plays the part of the interviewer -- tape the session  -- replay the tape  --  work on improving your 
responses.
<p>
<b>FIFTH</b>, Be positive!   Do not knock your last  company, or individuals in it..  Do not knock yourself!  Let the interviewer know what your capabilities are -- what you can  do!   Stay away from things you can't or don't 
like to do.  LIVE UP TO THE BEST IMAGE OF YOURSELF!
<p>
<b>SIXTH</b>, Try to postpone salary questions until you and the Company are both satisfied that you are the right individual for the position. Try to get them to make you an offer based on the salary range established for the position, and on their evaluation of you and your achievements. If this cannot be achieved, (salary information  is insisted upon), provide them with either a salary range of interest to you and/or your highest base salary.
<p>
<b>SEVENTH</b>, Try to center discussions on the duties of the position, its organizational setting (reporting relationship) and the short and long range goals the selected individual would be concerned with.
<p>
<b>EIGHTH</b>, Since you must usually survive a series of interviews before the position is offered, at the close of your interview ask your interviewer what the next course of events will be. If another interview is to be scheduled, try to set the appointment at this time. In any case, show him you are interested and even if your standing as a candidate is uncertain, ask when he'll contact you and get his okay in calling back, at a appropriate  time, to see where you stand.
<p>
<b>NINTH</b>, Never turn down a job before it is offered to you!
<p>
<b>TENTH</b>, Never fail to write a thank-you letter after each interview. This is your opportunity to reinforce the positive elements in an interview, cover thIngs you wIsh you had covered but didn't, and overcome objections raised regarding your viability as a candidate. Remember, do not forget to thank, by letter, the person who hires you to confirm verbal agreements!

<br><a name="questions" class=heading>QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK AT THE INTERVIEW</a><p>

Successful "listening" (job) interviews lead to job offers. In order to evaluate such job offers and to negotiate intelligently for adequate compensation, you should have certain basic information which may not be offered voluntarily by the interviewer.   A final  decision to accept or reject a job may be -- or should be -- influenced by the answers to some of the following questions. Of course, you should select only those questions which pertain to your own situation. Some of the information should be obtained through careful research prior to the interview. Much will become evident during the interview. The remainder may require very discreet, tactful and carefully-timed questioning of the interviewer.

<p>
There is no good substitute for careful research prior to an interview.
<p>
Avoid self-servlng questions that would tend to screen you out --  be company-oriented in your thinking.
<p>

Remember,  you're not an "inquisitor."
<p>
Pre-plan the wording of the questions you want to ask.

<br><a name="eval" class=heading>EVALUATING HOW IT WENT</a><p>

After your live interviews, be it with prospective employer or search firm, make notes immediately when you leave as to how you did:
<p>
1.	Did you listen without interrupting, as to what the Company or boss needed?
<p>
2.	Did you correctly read the signals?
<p>
3.	Did you articulate your relevant talents,  skills and experience?
<p>
4.	Did you leave with an atmosphere of mutual respect and regard?
<p>
5.	Do you feel good about how it went?
<p>
6.	Did the interviewer like you?
<p>
7.	Is there a plan for you to come back?
<p>
8.	What follow-up steps do you plan?
<p>
If you feel uncomfortable about how the interview went, you may want to talk to your consultant about further training.
<p>
The real proof of-the-pudding is to be called to come back again to talk with other top people.

<br><a name="follow" class=heading>INTERVIEW FOLLOW-UP LETTER</a><p>

After an interview, it is important that you prepare a follow-up letter to the manager with whom you spoke.<p>
The key ingredients of the letter should be:
<p>
1.	Thank the manager for the interview.
<p>
2.	Emphasize your interest for the position in question.
<p>
3.	Rephase your background and briefly explain how your experience can compliment the requirements of the position.
<p>
4.	Indicate that you intend to follow-up the letter with a telephone call to determine if and when the interviewer wishes to see you again.
<p>
If the position for which you interviewed is not a job you desire;  you should still send a follow-up letter expressing your thanks and informing the interviewer of your feeling. If you are still interested in the Company and would like to be considered for other positions which are more in line with your background and interests, let the Company know in the event a future position arises.
